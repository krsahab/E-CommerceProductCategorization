# Multi-Class Classification on text data

A project on Multi-Class Classification based on text data using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. 
The complete process includes Data Cleaning, Data Processing, and applying various Machine Learning methods and tools to categorize the text in appropriate classes. 
Technologies: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, K-Nearest Neighbor, Python, Keras, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK 

Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T0RwrnsVFXTX_Dj5Q6uo6iwL946-3XDC/view?usp=sharing 

Note: This entire process is specific to the above dataset only. It can be different for different kinds of data and tasks.
This project was developed as part of the Amazon Machine Learning Challenge and had an accuracy of 41% on 0.33% of the dataset and 50% on 1% of the dataset using Machine Learning Approach. BERT based approach achieved the accuracy of 82%.
